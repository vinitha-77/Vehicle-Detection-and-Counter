# Vehicle-Detection-and-Counter
Aim is to detect the vehicle and count number of vehicles travelling on 
road.  Traffic counts,speed and vehicle classification are fundamental data for a 
variety of transportation projects. Vision based video monitoring systems offer a number of advantages 
over earlier methods. In large metropolitan areas, there is a need for data about vehicle classes that use a particular highway or a street. 
A classification and counting system like the one proposed here can provide important data for a particular decision making agency.So this data will be helpful for the government to establish traffic signals 
or extension of roads etc., to reduce traffic and accidents. Our system detects the moments of vehicles by analyzing camera pictures with help of computer vision.
